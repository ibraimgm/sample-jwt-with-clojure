# jwttest

This is a sample showing how to use [JWT](http://www.webtoolkit.eu/jwt) with clojure. All code was based on [this old post](http://www.nsa.be/index.php/eng/Blog/Using-Jwt-yes-it-s-a-J-with-Clojure) and the help from [this question on StackOverFlow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12044204/clojure-servlet-and-jwt).

## Usage

Just load the namespace `jwttest.core` and run `startup` or `shutdown`. The url to view the test page will be `http://localhost:8080/foo/bar`.
